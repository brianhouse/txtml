XML documents always consist of hierarchically nested tags, and TXTML is executed as a depth-first traversal of this tree-structure, beginning at the level of the appropriate handler. For example, when a message is received from a user, the modules nested inside the {input} handler of the bead that user is assigned to will be recursively executed. 

Each element performs some action and in turn will execute any child elements (known as submodules) according to the outcome. Execution of a bead ends when either all the modules in a handler have been executed or an {send}, {return}, {end}, or {quit} module is encountered. 

The only possible return value of a module is a string of text. A module will concatenate any strings returned by its submodules and return the result. The exeception to this rule is the {txt} module, which instead of returning the string will send it to the current user as a text-message.
